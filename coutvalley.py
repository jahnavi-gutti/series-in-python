A mountain is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
A valley is a non-empty sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
Given Garyâ€™s sequence of up and down steps during his last hike, find and print the number of valleys he walked through."""
